	<h1 id="ScrumContH1">Scrum Description</h1>
	<p id="aboutP">
		Scrum is an Agile framework used by software development teams to help them complete projects faster by
    breaking down large projects into smaller more managable tasks which can be completed in a short period
    of time.
	</p>
  <p id="aboutP">
		When using the Scrum framework, teams use 'Scrum Meetings' to stay oragnised and plan the project and their
    work days. Scrum meetings is an umbrella term and can be used to describe; daily standup meetings, sprint 
    planning meetings, and retrospectives. 
	</p>
  <p id="aboutP">
		Scrum teams tend to have a few specialised roles, those being: Scrum master, Product Owner, and the 
    Development Team. For this project, Dan Harrison was agreed to be the Scrum Master and to take lead
    on the project. 
	</p>
  <p id="aboutP">
		Throughout the project, the team had a large day-long planning meeting to begin with on day one, which
    ensured that we were all on the same page, with the same goal in mind and knew how we were going to go about
    this. Over the course of this meeting a Project Management Kanban Board was also created, with user stories 
    and overarching Epics added to this. These Stories and Epics are used to break down the project into much
    smaller tasks.
	</p>
  <p id="aboutP">
		After this, daily standup meetings were held, lead by Dan, in which we would go around the room and briefly
    discuss what each of us were doing, or going to be working on over the course of the day. This helped us stay
    organised and ensure that we always all had a task to be working on and knew who we needed to coordinate with
    if our tasks overlapped. These standups also gave the floor to everybody to input any new ideas or thoughts
    we may have had since the end of the last work day.
	</p>
  <p id="aboutP">
		At the end of each work day, another standup meeting was held as a way to round out which tasks we had completed
    or worked out throughout the day, and gave us a better view of where we were with the project at the end of
    each day, so we could better attack the following day.
	</p>
  <p id="aboutP">
		All of these practices being followed allowed the team to have an extremely organised, and smooth running 
    product development cycle. Ensuring we hit MVP with little to no hiccups along the way. At all points 
    throughout the product development, all members of the team knew what they and all other members were
    working on, ensuring we had no issues with overlapping. And the constant communication ensured we always
    had a helping hand nearby if needed.
